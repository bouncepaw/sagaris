# Σαγαρις

![]()

Sagaris is a semichorded ergonomic free keyboard. You are reading its source code in its literate form. Tangled form that is fed to the compiler is extracted with [qara2c](https://github.com/bouncepaw/qara2c) program by the same author.

Whole source code can be read as an article. Actually, it'll be published as one when the time comes. Then you'll be able to find it on [my website](https://bouncepaw.github.io).

For now it's not an article.
